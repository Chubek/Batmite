# RuseIR

RuseIR stands as an Intermediate Representation (IR) crafted for versatile use, drawing inspiration from the likes of QBE and LLVM. In the compilation journey, RuseIR plays a pivotal role, offering a unified platform for diverse optimizations and code generation strategies.

While currently a work in progress, RuseIR has already seen the implementation of numerous features. The IR takes the form of an S-Expression language, known as the 'original representation,' generated by the compiler. This representation is subsequently translated into a Static Single Assignment (SSA) graph, a co-dependent Control Flow graph, and a co-independent Directed Acyclic Graph. RuseIR also incorporates a data flow graph.

One notable aspect of RuseIR is its 'code generator generator.' Leveraging an S-Expression language, it dynamically creates programming functions for each IR instruction, defined in ssa.c. Each instruction corresponds to an assembly production in a specified architecture. These generated functions serve as cost analyses for tile selection, where tiles represent chunks of IR instructions defined by the S-expression language along with productions, utilizing a tree grammar.

For a deeper understanding of RuseIR's inner workings, consider exploring the following resources:
