# Batmite Compiler Construction Suite (WIP)

Batmite is a suite of interconnected tools for compiler construction. It provides the necessary toolset for both the backend and the frontend of a compiler. It has a both a LALR and LL(1) parser/lexer generator, a tool to specify an intermediate language instruction set a tool to describe the target machine and generate the Assembly instructions, and finally, a tool to create an Assembler with. Furthermore, Batmite provies graphi-based IRs such as SSA, DAG, Interference Graph, Data Flow Graph and Control Flow Graph.
